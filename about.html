            <p>DC Driver app provides motorists timely scoring of their driving behavior. Operational ground truth like
                harsh acceleration, speed, hard braking, and cornering is used to calculate scores displayed on the home
                dashboard. The distraction score is determined using multiple vehicle motion factors and is intended to
                provide drivers an indication of their operational safety. The leaderboard displays a drivers score per
                category ranked among all DC Driver app users.</p>
            <p>DC Driver app is in public testing mode. User feedback is critical to ensure DC Driver provides useful
                information for motorists to continuously improve their safe driving skill. Suggestions are desired for
                new app features like customizable leaderboards, trip segment data and automobile operating systems
                interaction. Consider future permission enabled DC Driver app functionality that intervenes in vehicle
                operations when unsafe conditions are detected.</p>
            <p>Nationally, distracted driving is increasing along with other unsafe practices. The DC Driver app was
                developed by 2024 Class Howard University Computer Science students to decrease distracted driving among
                young motorists. DC Driver app seeks to assist safe driving behavior and aggregate research data to
                improve road design. Our team is proud that a Historically Black College & University (HBCU) is
                contributing this app to reduce a common practice leading to deadly outcomes. Our teamâ€™s desire is to
                engage current and future students across the U.S. in utilizing, evaluating and extending the DC Driver
                app to their region.</p>
            <p>Thanks to the Howard University Transportation Research Center for giving the DC Driver app a nurturing
                home. Thanks to Cambridge Mobile Telematics for enabling API usage, supplying technical support and
                encouraging our student pursuits.</p>
