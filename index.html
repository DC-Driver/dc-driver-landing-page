            <p>CMT's The State of Distracted Driving in 2023 & the Future of Road Safety report is the most
                comprehensive research available on naturalistic distracted driving behaviors at scale. The report
                covers distraction behavior trends from 2020 through 2022 across the US, the progress of individual
                states, the impact of hands-free legislation, studies on how telematics reduces distraction, driver
                sentiment, how distraction influences crash rates, and more.</p>
